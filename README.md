***Included Udacity course: [Material Design for Android Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862)***

This projects goal is to get familiar with the Material Guidelines, which is Google's design guideline introduced with Android Lollipop. Starting with a functionally working source code, design principles should be taken in account and applied. 

###Starting Code and Design Flaws
The app is called "XYZ Reader", which serves as an RSS feed reader. Items are shown in a list, selected items are shown in a detail view. As the screenshots clearly show, the design has really some design issues. The color is chosen in a way, that reduces contrast and therefore leads to a very bad user experience. Also the basic style of the app is inconsistent, with different shades of grey and a rather depressing look. Moreover, images are not scaled corretly and introduce misplaced margins and white spaces. Also the text font style needs some enhancements.
